# SOPS-encrypted secrets file
# This file contains encrypted secrets that are decrypted on-demand
# 
# To create your own secrets file:
# 1. Install sops: nix-shell -p sops
# 2. Generate an age key (see age/keys.txt template)
# 3. Create a .sops.yaml file in your config directory
# 4. Create your secrets file with:
#    sops secrets.yaml
#
# Example structure (before encryption):
# your_ssh_key_name: |
#   -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
#   ... your actual SSH private key ...
#   -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
# github_token: ghp_yourActualGitHubToken
#
# After encryption with SOPS, this file will contain encrypted data
# and SOPS metadata including age recipients.
