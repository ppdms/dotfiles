# SOPS-encrypted secrets file
# This file contains encrypted secrets that are decrypted on-demand
# 
# To create your own secrets file:
# 1. Install sops: nix-shell -p sops
# 2. Generate an age key (see age/keys.txt template)
# 3. Create a .sops.yaml file in the secrets directory
# 4. Create your secrets file with:
#    cd ~/.config/nix/private/secrets
#    sops secrets.yaml
#
# Example structure (before encryption):
#
# your_ssh_key_name: |
#   -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
#   ... your actual SSH private key ...
#   -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
#
# github_token: ghp_yourActualGitHubToken
#
# backup_age_key: |
#   # created: 2024-...
#   # public key: age1...
#   AGE-SECRET-KEY-...
#   (This is your backup key, stored encrypted here for convenience)
#
# After encryption with SOPS, this file will contain encrypted data
# and SOPS metadata including age recipients.
#
# To edit with automatic backups:
#   secrets  (alias configured in flake.nix)
# or
#   bash ~/.config/nix/public/scripts/secrets-edit-backup.sh
