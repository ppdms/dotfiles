# Example backup key file - Replace with your actual generated key
# This is a regular age key (NOT passphrase-protected)
# 
# Generate with: age-keygen -o backup-key.txt
# 
# Setup process:
# 1. Generate key: age-keygen -o ~/.config/nix/private/age/backup-key.txt
# 2. Run: bash ~/.config/nix/public/scripts/setup-backup-key.sh
#    (This will update .sops.yaml and guide you through adding the key to secrets.yaml)
# 3. Store the cleartext backup-key.txt somewhere safe:
#    - Password manager (as secure note)
#    - Encrypted USB drive
#    - Secure cloud storage
# 4. Use 'secrets' alias to edit - backups are created automatically
#
# The backup key allows you to:
# - Decrypt secrets.yaml if you lose access to Secure Enclave
# - Decrypt backup archives from ~/.config/nix/private/secrets/backups/
#
# See: public/scripts/BACKUP-QUICKSTART.md for complete instructions
#
# DO NOT commit this file unencrypted!
