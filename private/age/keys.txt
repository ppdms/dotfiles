# Age encryption key for SOPS
#
# This file should contain your age private key used to decrypt secrets.
#
# To generate a new age key:
# 1. Install age: nix-shell -p age
# 2. Generate a key: age-keygen -o keys.txt
#
# For macOS with Secure Enclave integration (age-plugin-se):
# 1. Install age-plugin-se: nix-shell -p age-plugin-se
# 2. Generate a key stored in Secure Enclave:
#    age-plugin-se -o keys.txt
#    (This will create a key protected by TouchID/passcode)
#
# Format:
# # created: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
# # public key: age1...
# AGE-SECRET-KEY-1...
#
# Or for Secure Enclave (age-plugin-se):
# # created: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
# # access control: any biometry or passcode
# # public key: age1se1...
# AGE-PLUGIN-SE-1...
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Keep this file secure and never commit it to version control!
# ⚠️  Add this to your .gitignore: private/age/keys.txt
